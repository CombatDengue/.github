## Combat Dengue
COMBAT is an ambitious initiative at the forefront of dengue research and pandemic preparedness, pioneering innovative antiviral strategies to alleviate the burden of dengue infection while deepening our understanding of its complex pathogenesis through cutting-edge multi-modal technologies.

The project stands at a pivotal crossroads in interdisciplinary research, merging the domains of biological science, physics, nanotechnology, computer science, and (bio)engineering. By crafting policy frameworks to address dengue threats in Europe and establishing a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary hub for scalable and affordable pandemic preparedness, COMBAT aims to revolutionize global health responses and equip communities to face emerging health crises with resilience and efficiency.
